# Magentic Multi-Agent Orchestration Guide

## What is Magentic?

**Magentic** is Microsoft Agent Framework's sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system. Think of it as hiring a **project manager** who coordinates a team of specialists to complete complex tasks.

```
Traditional Single Agent:
User → Agent → Result
(Limited by one agent's capabilities)

Magentic Multi-Agent:
User → Manager → Developer Agent  ┐
                 → Code Review Agent├→ Synthesized Result
                 → DevOps Agent     ┘
                 → QA Agent
(Combines expertise of multiple specialists)
```

## How Magentic Works

### 1. **Task Decomposition**
The Manager analyzes complex tasks and breaks them into subtasks.

**Example:**
```
User Request: "Build a web API with authentication"

Manager Plans:
  1. Developer: Create API structure
  2. Developer: Implement auth system
  3. Reviewer: Security audit
  4. QA: Write tests
  5. DevOps: Deploy to staging
```

### 2. **Intelligent Delegation**
The Manager assigns each subtask to the most qualified agent.

```
Task: "Fix security vulnerability"
Manager: Assigns to → Code Review Agent (security expert)

Task: "Deploy to production"
Manager: Assigns to → DevOps Agent (deployment expert)
```

### 3. **Progress Monitoring**
The Manager tracks progress and adapts the plan as needed.

```
If Developer encounters issue:
  Manager → Assigns to QA Agent to help debug
  Manager → Adjusts timeline
  Manager → Updates stakeholders
```

### 4. **Result Synthesis**
The Manager combines outputs from all agents into a coherent final result.

### Current Agents

1. **Magentic-Manager** (agent-3)
   - Role: Orchestrator & Project Manager
   - Coordinates: Developer + Code Reviewer
   - Resources: 1.5 CPU, 2GB RAM
   - Status: Ready to deploy

2. **Developer-Agent** (agent-1)
   - Specialist: Software development
   - Tools: File I/O, project creation
   - Coordinated by: Magentic-Manager

3. **CodeReview-Agent** (agent-2)
   - Specialist: Code quality & security
   - Tools: Code analysis, metrics, reports
   - Coordinated by: Magentic-Manager

## Deployment

### Deploy Magentic Manager

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/exoscale_deployment

# Deploy all agents including Magentic
docker-compose up -d --build

# Watch the Magentic Manager at work
docker-compose logs -f agent-3
```

### What You'll See

```
🧠 MANAGER [planning]:
Breaking down task into steps...
1. Developer will create the calculator
2. Reviewer will audit the code

👨‍💻 DeveloperAgent: Creating calculator.py with functions...
[Code generation happens...]

🔍 ReviewerAgent: Analyzing code for issues...
Found: Missing type hints on line 15
Suggestion: Add input validation

✅ FINAL RESULT:
Calculator created and reviewed.
Security: ✓ No vulnerabilities
Quality: ✓ Meets standards
Ready for deployment.
```

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

```python
Task: "Add user authentication to the API"

Magentic Orchestration:
  1. Developer: Implement JWT auth
  2. Reviewer: Security audit
  3. Developer: Fix issues found
  4. QA: Write auth tests
  5. DevOps: Deploy to staging

Result: Secure, tested auth system
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix

```python
Task: "Production error: API returns 500 on /users endpoint"

Magentic Orchestration:
  1. QA: Reproduce the bug
  2. Developer: Analyze logs
  3. Developer: Fix root cause
  4. Reviewer: Verify fix quality
  5. QA: Confirm bug resolved
  6. DevOps: Deploy hotfix

Result: Bug fixed and deployed
```

### Example 3: Code Refactoring

```python
Task: "Refactor payment processing module for better performance"

Magentic Orchestration:
  1. Reviewer: Analyze current bottlenecks
  2. Developer: Refactor code
  3. QA: Performance testing
  4. Reviewer: Code quality check
  5. Developer: Optimize further
  6. DevOps: A/B test deployment

Result: 3x performance improvement
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Checkpointing

Save workflow state and resume later:

```python
# Magentic automatically saves checkpoints
# If task fails, it can resume from last checkpoint
# No work is lost!
```

### 2. Human-in-the-Loop

Get human approval at critical steps:

```python
Manager: "Developer has created database migration.
         Reviewer found it safe.
         🛑 AWAITING HUMAN APPROVAL to run migration"
